Alton Brown here. You know, over the \nyears, we have cooked hard to illuminate the mysterious mechanisms behind \ndesserts. Most of you, enlightened by the scintillating science of sugar, now \nroam the cosmos of confections with neither fear nor trepidation.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; And yet, and yet, I sense that some of you hunger for more. \nMore flavor, perhaps, more sensation, more power. Yes, I feel the need growing \nin you even now. Perhaps you expect I can shed a little... [snaps his fingers, \nand the lights dim] darkness on the subject, and reveal a culinary force more \npowerful than anything you can imagine. Are you prepared to follow me into the \ndark side of dessert?<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Fine, let\'s go.</p>\n<h3><b><big>SCENE 1</big><br>\n</b>The Kitchen</h3>\n\n<p>The Living Room<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; [Kathleen Denson\'s picture "Chicken and a Bowler Hat" rises, \nto reveal a home safe deposit box] Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm. [enters a combination, \nand opens the safe] Behold, a source of unspeakable power. Hah hah hah. That\'s \nright, chocolate. Really, really, really dark chocolate.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; What did you expect, squid ink? You know, chocolate is the \nnew coffee, and since we shot our first chocolate episode, a plethora of dark \nbars have hit the market, opening up a whole new spectrum of dark culinary \npossibilities.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Just marvel at it. Dark chocolate from Madagascar, with its \nbright acidity, jet-black goodness from Trinidad/Tobago, with earthy spice. Ooh, \nthe cool, clean cocoa flavors of Indonesian dark. And then, of course, my \npersonal favorite obsidian delight, Venezuelan. Dark cherries anyone? Ahhh.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; [music evocative of "Star Wars"] Believe you me, until you \nknow the dark side, you\'ve only begun to discover chocolate\'s true power. Join \nme, and I will complete your training. With our combined strength we can end \nthis destructive conflict and bring order to the gal...<br>\nSorry, I meant...</p>\n<p>[Good Eats theme plays]</p>\n<h3><b><big>SCENE 1</big><br>\n</b>The Kitchen</h3>\n\n<p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Once upon a time, chocolate was chocolate. \nThen, we developed milk chocolate, and then semi-sweet chocolate. Eventually, of \ncourse, bittersweet chocolate, and then, the midnight ebony of the ever so \nslightly sinister dark chocolate. All descriptors that essentially mean nothing, \nother than whatever the marketing folks want them to mean.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Well those days are over. Now you go to buy chocolate, and \nyou are deluged with percentages, all right? Fifty percent, 60 percent, 68 \npercent, 75 percent, 80 percent, or even, 100 percent. One hundred percent of \nwhat? One hundred percent of cocoa mass, a.k.a. chocolate liquor. And, to better \nunderstand that, we have got to go to the source.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Although the tree we\'re about to meet, theobroma cacao, is \nmost likely born in jungles watered by both the Amazon and Orinoco Rivers, this \ntropical traveler is now cultivated on multiple continents, including Central \nAmerica, South America, Asia, India, and Africa. As for the U.S., we only grow \nand process cacao in one state. And I\'d say this calls for a field trip.</p>\n<h3><b><big>SCENE 1</big><br>\n</b>The Kitchen</h3>\n\n<p>Original Hawaiian Chocolate Factory &#x2013; Kona, HI</p>\n<p><b>GUESTS:</b> Bob and Pam Cooper, proprietors</p>\n<p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; A field trip to the big island of Hawaii, \nwhich is essentially a large hunk of lava that sits out in the middle of the \nPacific Ocean. I arrive by big jet airplane, and then rent myself a vehicle. A \nfour-wheel drive vehicle, which is what most people around here drive. Again, \nit\'s got to do with all that lava.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; I head south down the coast, into the heart of Kona, and then \nup into the hills, to find The Original Hawaiian Chocolate Factory, which is \nnestled amongst papaya and even coffee trees, which you see there in the \nforeground. And then I arrive at the factory.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Original Hawaiian has an interesting story, because a few \nyears ago it was taken over, and is now run by a couple from North Carolina of \nall places. This is Bob and Pam Cooper, and they were happy to have another \nsoutherner on their soil. Immediately, they lead me to the trees.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; A chocolate grove, or chocolate walk as they used to call it, \nis rather cathedral-like. The trees, and these are forasteros, as opposed to \ncriollo chocolate trees, knit together to form a thick, dense canopy, which is \nactually important for their growth. Now the pods, interestingly enough, just \ngrow out of the tree, wherever they want - trunk, limb, they don\'t care, and \neach one is born of a little bitty flower. That\'s going to be chocolate one day.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; All right, the reason that this has to be done by hand, by \nskilled labor, is because discerning a ripe chocolate pod, which can come in \nmany different colors, is actually tricky. You have to spot one by scraping the \noutside skin. If it\'s not green underneath, you\'re probably good to go. \nEverything else needs to be left in place. Here, for instance, the one on the \nleft is ripe, the one on the right is not. I worked the grove for close to an \nhour. It\'s easy for ripe pods to hide behind the leaves in the dense foliage, \nbut slowly and surely, I accumulate an entire wheelbarrow full. And every one of \nthese pods is exactly the same variety, despite the different colors.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Now cracking into one of these is a little tricky. Use a \ncleaver and lightly cut your way in. [cuts into a pod] You don\'t want to go so \ndeeply that you damage some of the seeds within. Now here\'s the strange part. \n[shows the seeds inside the pod] Those are cocoa seeds. Kind of netted together \nby a white, sticky, sweet pulp, which is probably what attracted mammals to \ncacao in the first place. It\'s sweet, it\'s tasty, but it in no way tastes \nchocolaty, and of course, there\'s that seed to contend with. [tastes one, and \nspits out the seed] There. You basically just strip all of the pulpy seeds out \nof the pod, and then move them to a fermenter. Basically a big box, where over \nabout a 10-day period, yeasts naturally convert the outer pulp to alcohol, \nincreasing the inner temperature of the seeds enough to shut down the \ngermination process.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; After that, the seeds are transferred to open racks for \ndrying in wind and sun. They darken; they dry to about six to seven percent \nmoisture, and they actually do start to smell a lot like the chocolate they will \nbecome. And if you actually bother biting into one, you\'ll find that well, they \ndo taste chocolaty, but you sure wouldn\'t want to sit down and eat a bowl of \nthem.</p>\n<p><b>Most cacao farmers around the world \nship dry beans to other countries for processing.</b></p>\n<h3><b><big>SCENE 1</big><br>\n</b>The Kitchen</h3>\n\n<p>Original Hawaiian Chocolate Factory &#x2013; Kona, HI</p>\n<p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Now we move to actual chocolate \nprocessing. The first step is roasting, and Bob uses just a large coffee roaster \nto cook the beans to the temperature that he likes. Kind of a secret. He \nwouldn\'t tell me. The seeds are then cooled down, and at this point, the outer \nshell kind of separates away from the inner nib, but it still has to be \nphysically removed, and that requires this machine, a winnower, which basically \nshakes, rattles, and rolls those seeds around until the outer shell is removed. \nIt is then sorted out, so that all you\'re left with is the inner nib. The actual \nsource of all chocolate, which you see right there in that bin.<br>\nIn the next room, things get a little noisy.</p>\n<h3><b><big>SCENE 1</big><br>\n</b>The Kitchen</h3>\n\n<p>Original Hawaiian Chocolate Factory &#x2013; Kona, HI</p>\n<p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; [AB is wearing headphones, and shouting to \nbe heard over the noise of the machinery] So, this machine is actually a \ncombination of grinder and concher, OK? First it grinds the cocoa nibs down into \nwhat\'s called "cocoa liquor", which is like a paste. Then you add the rest of \nthe ingredients, usually sugar and cocoa butter. And then it conches it - mixes \nit together for up to 16 hours. During that time, not only are the ingredients \ncombined, but the volatile acids that might throw off the flavor of the \nchocolate are vaporized out into the air. It takes a long time, but it\'s got to \nbe done [puts his hand on the grinder, which is very hot]. Arrggghh!<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; After the very noisy grinding and conching, the new chocolate \nmoves into the tempering phase, a process of raising and lowering the \ntemperature until the chocolate sets into a solid bar. We\'ll get more into that \nlater. Now there\'s the liquid goodness, which is then just squirted into plastic \nmolds. Bob is making up a one-pound bar here. They sell those to chefs. He then \nputs it on a shaking table to vibrate out any bubbles that may accumulate in the \nchocolate. Then, it is onto a rack.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Now, at Original Hawaiian Chocolate Factory, they do this by \nhand several days of the week. Got to be very careful to move those molds, and \nthen the chocolate is moved into a very special cooling room, where the \ntemperature is in the 60s and the humidity is quite low. They make the big \nmistake of leaving me in this room, by myself, completely unguarded, as I check \nout the wares. Eventually I am overcome with both greed and curiosity, and give \none of those one-pound dark chocolate bars just a little nibble, to see what \nAmerican chocolate can really be like.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Good is what it can be like. Very, very good. So, I decide to \nbuy out the place, and fill my suitcase with pretty much everything they make, \nfrom dark chocolate to milk chocolate, and, I don\'t know, everything in between.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; After that, I bid the Coopers a fond farewell, and promise to \nbuy their plantation from them at some later date. Then, I head on down the \nhill, back to civilization. Against my will, I might add.</p>\n<p><b>The word "chocolate" was coined by \nthe Spanish and combines two pre-Colombian word chocol (hot) and atl (water).</b></p>\n<h3><b><big>SCENE 1</big><br>\n</b>The Kitchen</h3>\n\n<p>A Pre-Colombian Set<br>\n&#xA0;</p>\n<p><b>GUEST:</b> And anonymous conquistador<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Two Spanish \ndoctors</p>\n<p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; [AB ascends to the throne of a \npre-Colombian setting] So, how long has chocolate been consumed, you ask? Well, \nsince it was the only pre-Colombian food to contain the alkaloids caffeine and \ntheobromine, it\'s relatively simple to detect in trace amounts using mass \nspectrometry.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Research shows that the ancient Olmec people were already \ndrinking chocolate, thousands of years before Cortes busted up Montezuma\'s \nchocolate binge.<br>\nNow what was it like? Well we know from eyewitness accounts, as well as ancient \nart, that it had a frothy head on it, a "spuma", if you will, that was whipped \ninto being by repeatedly pouring the liquid back and forth between two goblets. \nWhat did it taste like? Well, if you were to drink it today, you probably \nwouldn\'t even know it was chocolate. It was thickened with maize and seasoned \nwith... [tastes] chilies, maybe a little vanilla, and achiote, I believe. This \nis a bitter quaff indeed, served just at room temperature. The Spanish didn\'t \nmuch care for it, but one of Cortes\' cronies did note:</p>\n<p><b>CONQUISTADOR:</b> The drink is the healthiest thing, and \nthe greatest sustenance of anything you can drink in the world, because he who \ndrinks a cup of this liquid, no matter how far he walks, can go a whole day \nwithout eating anything else.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Caffeine and theobromine are, of course, \npowerful stimulants, capable of energizing and creating a sense of well-being in \nthe imbiber. No wonder Aztec priests fed it to prospective sacrifices. You know, \njust to keep their spirits up.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Anyway, these pharmacological effects were not lost on the \nconquistadors, so off to Spain cacao went. It was there, in the royal court, \nwhere chocolate first met its soul mate, sugar, which, of course, will only \ndissolve in a hot liquid. And since all that pouring back and forth between \ngoblets would cool said drink, the Spanish invented the molinillo, a wooden \nwhisk that, when spun between the palms, created such a lovely foam, it\'s still \nused back in Mexico to this day.<br>\nNow Spain kept chocolate to itself until 1660, when Princess Maria Theresa \ntraipsed off to Versailles to marry Louis XIV. Not only did the king learn to \nlove chocolate, his cooks enriched it by adding an egg yolk.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Chocolate\'s fame grew, in great part due to the raves of the \nmedical community:</p>\n<p><b>DOCTOR #1:</b> Chocolate is one of the most wholesome and \nprecious drinks to have been discovered to this day.<br>\n<b>DOCTOR #2:</b> Chocolate nourishes and preserves health entirely, yet causes \na pleasant and natural sleep and rest.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Still, chocolate was royal stuff. Even if \nyou could afford it, you could not secure so much as a bean if you didn\'t have \nroyal connections. That was, of course, in the continent. England was a little \nbit more of a democratic place, and the bean of our desire did arrive there \nabout the same time as coffee and tea. More expensive than the first, cheaper \nthan the latter, and infinitely more nutritious than either.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Pretty soon, chocolate houses exploded all over town. But, \nthe final link to modern hot chocolate would actually take place, not in London, \nbut in Jamaica. There, in 1687, an English physician name of Hans Sloane, for \nwhich London\'s Sloane Square is named, got the idea of mixing the local cocoa \ndrink with dairy, and thus the trinity of cacao, sugar, and milk was established \nin the culinary firmament, and I, for one, firmly believe that the most intense \nchocolate experience you can have is from a steaming cup or mug.</p>\n<p><b>The Aztecs drank chocolate during \nreligious ceremonies as a symbol of human blood.</b></p>\n<h3><b><big>SCENE 1</big><br>\n</b>The Kitchen</h3>\n\n<p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; My hot cocoa starts at the source. The \nroasted, cracked seeds, or nibs. Now, ten years ago, you had to know somebody in \nthe business to get hold of these babies, but now they\'re easily sourced via \nInternet and many mega marts. I have one ounce here, and I\'m going to brew them, \njust like coffee, which means grind them. Just three or four pulses are all it \ntakes. Basically, you want it to look, well, pretty much like ground coffee, \nwhich it does.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; [at the microwave] Pour one pint, that\'s 16 fluid ounces of \nwhole milk, into a microwave-safe one-quart measuring container. Add the nibs, \nand microwave on high for three to four minutes, or until you hit 160 degrees. \nOf course you could do this up on the cook top, but every time I turn my back on \nmilk in a saucepan, I end up with a big, hot, nasty mess. Plus, the nuker\'s \nfaster.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; All right, 163 - good enough. Now, as with coffee, cocoa nibs \nneed to steep. So, set this aside for 30 minutes.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Finally, we chop six ounces of dark chocolate. Somewhere in \nthe 65 percent to 70 percent cocoa range. Now, when dealing with a large, \ncommercial block, I like to use a serrated knife and a wooden mallet to safely \nhack my way through. But, let\'s face it, for six ounces, we can use small bars, \nwhich are easily dismantled with nothing but a chef\'s knife. I like to use the \nrocking maneuver, being very careful to keep the fingers of my left hand clear \naway from the blade.<br>\nNow, transfer to the carafe of a one-liter French coffee press, along with three \nounces of sugar, a quarter teaspoon of kosher salt, and two ounces of water. \nReturn the nibbed milk back to the nuker for two minutes on high, just to get it \nup to a bare simmer. About 180 to 185 degrees. Then simply pour through a fine \nmesh strainer into the press, and allow to sit for one minute before stirring to \nthoroughly melt the chocolate.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; And now the finishing touch. Attach the French press strainer \nand pump all the way up and down, gently, 10 to 12 times. That\'s going to serve \ntwo purposes. First, the fine mesh will emulsify the fat and water phases of the \nbeverage, creating a smooth texture. And, it will aerate the mixture, producing \nthe frothy head that Montezuma savored to the tune of 50 goblets a day. Then, \nget yourself a cup and pour.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; To my mind, this is the definitive expression of dark \nchocolate. [tastes] Ah, and as for the leftovers, simply move those to a \nstandard 16-cube ice tray and freeze until very, very solid. That\'ll be \nsomewhere between four and six hours, depending on their original temperature. \nAt that point, you can remove and either bag and save, or, well what the heck, \nlet\'s just go straight over to my favorite blender. Dump all the cubes into your \nblender, along with about half a cup of whole milk. Now, you can change that up \ndepending on your taste, but I\'m going for a whole batch here. Pour in the dairy \nand then slowly crank up your blender, and blend until completely smooth.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; And so we see what was born a hot chocolate, is now a \nmilkshake, or a frappe, to be technically correct. Blend with coffee instead of \nmilk, and you\'ve got yourself a mocha frappe. Very nice indeed.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Although its chemical complexity is life-giving manna, dark \nchocolate has long been marketed as an edible harbinger of doom. Just check out \nthe cookie aisle of your local mega mart. "Death by Chocolate," "Devil\'s \nDelight," "Darth Cookie," and "Mount Dooms," all promise to be the ultimate in \ndarkest decadence. Kid stuff.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; If you really want to turn up the dark, you simply must try \nmy chocapocalypse now cookies, which are so dark they actually suck invisible \nlight, as well as the meows of little lost kittens. [a kitten puppet appears] \nWhat\'s the matter, cookie got your tongue?</p>\n<h3><b><big>SCENE 1</big><br>\n</b>The Kitchen</h3>\n\n<p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; To perform this not-quite-black-magic \ntrick will require chocolate. Lots of chocolate. Six ounces of 54 percent \nbittersweet, two ounces unsweetened chocolate, that\'s 100 percent cacao, three \nounces each 70 percent chocolate and 40 percent milk chocolate, which is just \nbarely chocolate at all, if you ask me. We\'ll also require two ounces of cocoa \nnibs. Enough talk, we chop!<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Good, now, combine the 54 percent and 100 percent chocolate \nin a heat-proof bowl. Most recipes that call for melting chocolate specify the \nuse of a metal bowl over simmering water. It\'s known as a double boiler. I don\'t \nlike this arrangement for a few reasons. One, the metal bowl tends to absorb way \ntoo much heat up off of the sides of the pan. That could burn the chocolate. But \nalso, as the steam rises, it can condense and introduce water into the chocolate \nmass. And that means it\'s probably going to seize into a giant, irreversible wad \nof doom. You see, melted chocolate is a colloid, right? Tiny, dry particles \nsuspended in fat. You add water to the equation, the particles stick together. \nKind of like when you stir your coffee and put the spoon back in the sugar bowl. \nOddly enough, the situation can only be repaired by adding more liquid. We\'ll \nget into that later; it doesn\'t help us now.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; So, what is the answer? I put the chocolate in a glass bowl, \nand heat it in the microwave, all right? Two 30-seconds bursts, at high, \nstirring after each, should do the trick. If it doesn\'t, then I just continue to \nmicrowave at 10-second intervals thereafter, stirring until smooth. What\'s \nimportant here is that at no time during the process does the chocolate exceed \n120 degrees, or it will burn. How will you know? Well you can either stir it \nwith an instant-read thermometer, or better yet, you can read it with one of \nthese handy-dandy infrared or IR thermometers, which have rightfully become \npopular. This is not just a multitasker, it\'s a polytasker. The highest honor \n"Good Eats" can bestow upon a kitchen device. So, our first 30 seconds begins \nnow.</p>\n<p><b>The laser light on IR thermometers is \nfor targeting only. (Don\'t point into eyes!)</b></p>\n<h3><b><big>SCENE 1</big><br>\n</b>The Kitchen</h3>\n\n<p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; We begin to build our batter with six \nounces of light brown sugar and four tablespoons of unsalted butter at room \ntemperature, cut into several pieces. It\'ll make this go faster. Beat that on \nmedium speed until it looks kind of like wet sand. That\'ll probably take about \ntwo minutes. And then, slowly work in two eggs, beat with one teaspoon of \nvanilla extract.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; [at the microwave] Excellent, 117.5. So stir it until it is \nsmooth, and then just let it cool down until it\'s about 90 degrees.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; [at the counter top] While the chocolate cools, combine one \nand three-quarter ounces &#x2013; that\'s about a third of a cup &#x2013; of all-purpose flour, \nwith a half teaspoon each baking powder and kosher salt, and move it to a paper \nplate, if you have one.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Now we add the cooled chocolate, and I would do this on a \nrelatively low speed as to not splatter it around, and then as soon as the \nchocolate is worked in, slowly add the dry goods, also beating until thoroughly \ncombined. There, you\'re going to have to stop and scrape down the sides at least \nonce, if not twice.<br>\nThen, restart the machine, again on low, and bring forth the chocolates. We have \nthe 40 percent, or milk chocolate, the 70 percent chocolate - basically, \nbittersweet - and the cocoa nibs, which are going to supply a seductive crunch \nto the final cookie.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; [at the refrigerator] Once everything is properly mixed, \nstash your batter in the refrigerator for 45 minutes before scooping. Why? \nBecause these cookies have a seriously out-of-whack weakener to strengthener \nratio, meaning that the weight of the butter and cocoa butter seriously outweigh \nthe starch and protein from the flour. That means that if you were to put the \ncookies in a hot oven right now, they\'d just run off the side of the pan. \nChilling will buy the outer surface of the cookie some time so that they\'ll set, \nthus entombing the lovely gooeyness within.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; [back at the countertop] Now when dosing out, you want to \nmake sure you\'ve got at least two inches between each cookie, on parchment, on a \nhalf sheet pan. That\'ll still allow you about 16 cookies per pan, and you can \nbake two racks at a time. As for portioning, notice I\'m using a disher in the \none inch range. Yes, it makes a relatively small cookie but... [shows a replica \nof the "noisy cricket", like the weapon used in the movie "Men in Black"] Yeah, \nthat\'s what I\'m talking about.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; It is important that you do not dose out more than you can \nbake. Keep the rest of the batter either refrigerated, or you can go ahead and \nscoop it out, and move it directly into the freezer for baking at a later date. \nOnce they\'re rock hard, in a couple of hours, I would transfer to a zip-top bag \nfor no more than six months.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; [at the oven] To bake, park in a 350 degree oven for eight to \nnine minutes, rotating the pans halfway through the process.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; When they are finished, the cookies will still look rather \nwet. That\'s a good thing. Cool for two minutes on the pans, and then slide the \nparchment sheets onto racks, until they\'re cool enough to eat without burning \nyour face off.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; As for serving, plain out-of-hand eating is an insidiously \nchocolaty experience, but believe me when I say making little ice cream \nsandwiches with them is so good, it\'s illegal in nine states. It\'s just... too \npowerful. [AB walks off, and the kitten reappears]</p>\n<p><b>No actual kittens were harmed during \nthe production of this show.</b></p>\n<h3><b><big>SCENE 1</big><br>\n</b>The Kitchen</h3>\n\n<p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; The next lesson for practitioners of the \ndark arts is a tricky one indeed - enrobing. That is the coating of an edible \nitem in chocolate, which then sets to a snappy, delicious, shell-like coating. \nThis bit of edible legerdemain is made possible by chocolate\'s fat face, cocoa \nbutter.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Unlike most food fats, cocoa butter is polymorphic, meaning \nit can crystallize in several different configurations. Six in fact, each with \nits own specific melting points. Now, just take a look here. Here are the \ncrystals, and four of them are highly unstable, and create chocolate that\'s \ndull, gooey and streaky. Yeah, they\'re Tinkertoys. Just work with me, okay? \nHowever, form V are beta crystals, and form VI crystals are highly stable, \nresulting in a chocolate that is shiny, snappy, and slow-melting, a condition we \nrefer to as being "in temper."<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Now, since form VI crystals naturally evolve from the beta \ncrystals over time, our goal, as practitioners of the dark arts, is to create as \nmany betas as possible, while eradicating forms I through IV, got it? All right, \nnow we begin by heating the dark chocolate to 115 degrees, thus dissolving all \nthe crystalline forms.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Now at this point, we could coax betas into being through a \ncomplex series of time and temperature-sensitive maneuvers, each seemingly \ndesigned to make the average chocolatier lose one temper while failing to gain \nthe other. Or, we can simply seed this dark brew with beta crystals, which, \ngiven a bit of time and the proper environment, would replicate themselves. \nSound simple? Actually, it is.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; We are going to need one kilo, that\'s 2.2 pounds of dark \ncouverture chocolate. Now, that\'s chocolate containing between 32 and 39 percent \ncocoa butter. Couvertures are typically labeled as such. Now you can certainly \nbuy couvertures in bars of different shapes and sizes. I think it\'s worth \nseeking out couverture pastilles, or pistoles, which are basically chocolate \nchips on steroids. They\'re preferred by many professionals, because they\'re easy \nto dose out, and they melt evenly, which is important. But, since there\'s a lot \nof surface area here, there is more of a chance for the chocolate to be damaged \nby mishandling, so only purchase from reliable sources.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; You are also going to need food grade cocoa butter, and I buy \nmine in a four-ounce jar. I say food grade because cocoa butter is also heavily \nused in the cosmetics industry, and you don\'t want that version.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; All right now, regardless of the amount of chocolate you are \nattempting to temper, you want to seed it with one percent by weight of the \ncocoa butter, all right? Since we\'ve got a kilo of chocolate, 2.2 pounds, that \nis a mere 10 grams. Now I realize that you may not have a super sweet pocket \ndigital scale yet, and if you don\'t, that\'s fine, just go with two tablespoons \ninstead. That\'ll do &#x2018;ya.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; All right, here\'s the sequence. Stay with me. We\'re going to \nnuke our kilo, or 2.2 pounds of chocolate for 30 seconds on high, all right? \nWe\'re going to remove it and stir it, with either a wooden spoon or a spatula of \nsome type. I know it doesn\'t look very melted now, but this is important to \nevenly distribute the heat.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Now, return it to the microwave and nuke it for another 30 \nseconds on high. Take it out and stir it again. You\'ll see it\'s going to be a \nlittle bit more melted as you start to move that mass around.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Then, we\'re going to nuke a third time at 30 seconds. Remove \nand guess what? You\'re right, you\'re going to stir it again. Really stir it this \ntime. You want to move that mass around so there aren\'t any hot pockets down in \nthe chocolate.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Now, we\'re going to switch to 15 second bursts, on high, \nstirring each time until we reach 100 degrees. [measures the temperature] You \nknow what, 97 is close enough for me. Now, we\'re going to move to 10 second \nbursts. Ten seconds, stir, 10 seconds, stir, until you reach 115 degrees. It \ncould take as many as five times. Well, 114.1, good enough for me.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Now simply stir, and allow that chocolate to cool over the \nnext few minutes, until it is down to 95 degrees. 95.2 is good enough. Now it\'s \ntime to scatter our seeds.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; As the cocoa butter is stirred in, beta crystals are being \ndispersed into the mass, setting off a chain reaction, which will, as the \nchocolate cools to 90 degrees, result in the creation of millions of more beta \ncrystals. Once the temperature does hit 90, with any luck, the chocolate will be \nin temper and suitable for use as a coating.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; All right, we\'re at 90 degrees, this should be in temper. How \ncan we be sure? Well, grab yourself something flat and metal, like this spatula \nand dip in a little. There.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; [at the refrigerator] Park this in the refrigerator and wait, \nah, we\'ll say five minutes.</p>\n<p><b>Recent research has proven that dark \nchocolate is good for your heart... in moderation, of course.</b></p>\n<h3><b><big>SCENE 1</big><br>\n</b>The Kitchen</h3>\n\n<p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Ah, behold the hallmarks of chocolate in \nproper temper. Now you may not be able to really tell, but the chocolate\'s \ncontracted a bit. It\'s hard as a rock, has kind of a matte shine to it, and it \nis smooth, not tacky to the touch. This is what you want to see.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Now that we are in possession of melted, but well-tempered \ndark chocolate, it is time to take a dip. Now, this is going to take a little \nwhile, and you want to keep the chocolate at a workable temperature. Ideally \nbetween 88 and 90 degrees, so I find that placing the bowl inside another bowl, \nlined with a hot pad set to low, will keep it in a workable state longer. I also \nhave here a landing pad composed of some parchment paper, on top of an inverted \nhalf sheet pan, on top of re-usable freezer packs. That will help the chocolate \nto set quickly, and not to run off the dipped item.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Now when it comes to choosing items, the sky is the limit. \nYou can dip pretzels, candied orange peels, baby back ribs. [looks at the ribs, \nperhaps thinking better of having said that] Um, strawberries have never really \nbeen a favorite dipper of mine, but cherries are another matter altogether. I \nmean, who doesn\'t like a chocolate-covered cherry. And after all, they have \nstems, which makes this easier.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; So, for each one of your foods, give a stir, dip, carefully \nretract, and count to about five, so that the excess chocolate can drizzle off, \nand then move to the resting place. Now if you\'ll just hold it for a moment, the \nbase should set nicely, and you can let go and the fruit will stay upright. Now \nobviously this is going to take a little bit of time, but the heating pad should \nbuy you that time. Just remember to stir the chocolate often, and you might want \nto hit it with a thermometer every now and then to make sure that it stays below \n90 degrees, or things will get out of hand fast.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Now I can see that you\'re wondering, "Is there another way to \ntemper chocolate - perhaps an easier way?" No, not really. However, it is \npossible to melt chocolate without letting it lose its temper in the first \nplace. It\'s a risky maneuver but it can be done.</p>\n<p><b>A powdery white finish on a chocolate \nbar is called bloom and is a result of improper handling.</b></p>\n<h3><b><big>SCENE 1</big><br>\n</b>The Kitchen</h3>\n\n<p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; [at the food processor] America, say hello \nto your very own chocolate tempering machine. That\'s right, a standard food \nprocessor in the 750-watt range.<br>\nNow let\'s say that you have a pound of couverture chocolate, finely chopped, \nalready inside the machine, and be sure that it is tempered chocolate. If you \nsee any fat bloom on it before chopping, do not attempt this maneuver. All \nright, now let\'s say that you gave this, ah, we\'ll say, 25 one-second pulses. \n[demonstrates]<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Now at this point, the chocolate should resemble fine bread \ncrumbs. That\'s exactly what you want to see, kind of a coarse chocolate powder. \nNow, put the lid back on, and allow the machine to run for 60 solid seconds. \nThen stop and kind of scrape down the sides. It\'s going to be kind of chunky, \nbut just work with it. Then allow it to rest for 60 seconds. Then, start it up \nand let it run for another 60 seconds. Scrape down the sides, and then allow it \nto rest another 60 seconds.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Now what exactly is going on here? Well, you might think that \nheat from the motor is actually melting the chocolate, but it\'s actually \nnegligible. Remember the chocolate mass is full of solid particles. These \nparticles would be cocoa powder if the cocoa butter were all wrung out. Anyway, \nas the motor spins, the solid particles rub together, creating heat. Not enough \nto start a fire, mind you, but certainly enough to get the chocolate to a \nliquidous state. If we can achieve this without crossing the 91 degree \nFahrenheit line, we can preserve beta crystals, while eliminating most of the \nother less stable crystal forms.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; So, just keep repeating the cycle. One minute of process, \nwipe down, one minute rest, wipe down, one minute process, until your IR \nthermometer or your instant-read indicates 90 to 91 degrees Fahrenheit. Now the \nexact amount of processing required will depend greatly upon the temperature of \nyour kitchen, the quality of the chocolate, and the power of your processor. \nAnd, just as before, you want to check the temper, using a metal implement, \nrefrigerated for at least five minutes.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Of course, I\'ve already dipped everything short of my car \nkeys in chocolate today, so I think it\'s time to make bark. Chocolate bark does \nnot actually come off of the logs of chocolate trees at all. It is, however, a \nconfection named for the fact that it does look a lot like the bark that comes \noff a tree. And the nice thing about bark is it can be filled with all sorts of \nwonderful items. My personal favorite combination is actually the classic rocky \nroad, named, of course, after rocky road ice cream, which contains marshmallows, \nbut I find that marshmallow creme is superior.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Concocted in Somerville, Massachusetts, by one Archibald \nQuery, in 1917, marshmallow creme is one of very few American confections still \nkicking around after almost 100 years. Of course, I make mine from scratch, but \nI\'m a freak, and we all know it. We\'re going to need two ounces of marshmallow \ncreme per pound of chocolate, and, since we want a little crunch with our mush, \nwe will include four ounces of roasted, salted almonds. My very favorite choco-nut.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Now before working with the chocolate, we want it to be at 90 \ndegrees. If it\'s cooled down a little, hit it with the hair dryer for a few \nseconds, and then put the lid back on and take it for a quick spin, just to help \ndistribute that heat. This is a good method to increase the temperature by just \na couple of degrees.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Now that hole in the middle of the food processor bowl can be \na pain to work with, so I stick a champagne cork in there. Place the marshmallow \ncreme into a zip top bag, snip one end, and then distribute about a third of it \ninto the chocolate mixture. It is sticky stuff and I\'m not going to lie. It \nwon\'t be easy. You also want to put about two-thirds of the almonds directly \ninto the chocolate, and then just use a spatula, kind of going around the \ncircumference there to work that in. There, that\'s fine.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Now we\'re going to move that again to a parchment-lined back \nof a half sheet pan, and you can certainly use the ice packs underneath that. \nNow spread out that bark nice and thin. You don\'t want this more than about a \nquarter of an inch thick. And then distribute the rest of the creme and the \nalmonds directly onto the bark. Then I typically take just a small, offset \nspatula and kind of work it into the chocolate, so that I get more of swirl \neffect when I bite into it.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; If you\'re feeling particularly Wonka-esque, you can put your \nmixture into reusable candy bar molds, which are easily found on the Internet, \nor wherever you bought your cocoa butter, I would expect. In either case, the \nbark should be set in about half an hour, if the room is cool and dry.<br>\nSpeaking of, whenever working with chocolate, it\'s a good idea to monitor both \nthe temperature and humidity. Try to keep it under 70 and 50 if at all possible.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; \nIn Georgia, the last one\'s kind of tough.</p>\n<p><b>"All you need is love. But a little \nchocolate now and then doesn\'t hurt."<br>\n&#x2013;Lucy van Pelt</b></p>\n<h3><b><big>SCENE 1</big><br>\n</b>The Kitchen</h3>\n\n<p><b>GUESTS:</b> Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; A \nFrench prostitute<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; \nItchy<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; \nTwitchy<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; \nThing, the hand</p>\n<p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; When your chocolate bark is set, break \ninto pieces and store in tents. Perfect for holiday gift giving - to me that is.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Now if you don\'t dig rocky road, try your own combo, but try \nto include something chewy, and crisp or crunchy in each version. Dried fruit \nand granola, caramels, pretzels, breakfast cereal, that kind of thing. With \ntempered dark chocolate in your bowl, the depths of decadence are beyond limit. \nBut, decadent doesn\'t have to mean heavy. There is, in fact, one classic \napplication that perfectly captures the unbearable lightness of being dark \nchocolate. I speak, of course, of the dessert whose invention is oddly, and I \nsuspect, falsely attributed to... [knocking at the back door]</p>\n<p><b>AB:</b> Ah, bonjour.<br>\n<b>TOULOUSE-LAUTREC:</b> Bonjour. Here. Here is your mousse, you silly cook-type \nperson.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; [the prostitute hands AB a painting, based \non the famous "Moulin Rouge: La Goulue" poster by Toulouse-Lautrec. The dancers \nhave been replaced by moose, and the words "Moulin Rouge" in the original have \nbeen replaced by the word "mouse", perhaps a failed word play on "mousse"]</p>\n<p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Toulouse-Lautrec did not create chocolate \nmousse, anymore than Thomas Jefferson invented macaroni and cheese.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Mousse means "froth" or "foam" en francais, and that is \nexactly what it is - a light, chocolaty foam. Classically, this lightness is \ncreated by a tedious procedure involving the whipping and folding not only of \ncream or another dairy, into a chocolate base, but egg whites as well. It\'s \nbasically a cold souffl&#xE9;. Any slight misstep along the way can create a grainy, \ngrit that lingers on the tongue like sand. Not good eats. Luckily, there is \nanother way to create the lightness we desire, and without the dairy that can so \noften muffle chocolate\'s more fruity overtones.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Start by combining eight ounces of finely chopped, 54 percent \nbittersweet chocolate, with 1.5 ounces by weight of sugar, and half a cup each \nof water and freshly brewed coffee, in a medium, metal mixing bowl, set over a \nwide saut&#xE9; pan, with one inch of simmering water.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Please note, I am using a water method here because I\'ve \nalready introduced enough liquid to the party to prevent any seizing. Note \nfurther that this is not a double boiler, but a bain-marie, or hot water bath. \nThe pan is actually wider than the bowl, and although the bowl is indeed sitting \nright down in the simmering water, I consider this to be a more reliable method \nof melting than anything using steam.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Now once you\'ve got a thoroughly melted and fairly homogenous \nmixture, move the bowl to an ice bath to cool. Now since it can move more mass \nat one time than a spatula, and also helps to aerate, I generally switch to a \nwhisk at this point. Now we\'re looking for 60 degrees as our target, at which \npoint the consistency will resemble heavy cream. This is important, as hot cocoa \nbutter will not hold the bubbles to come.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; And those bubbles will be produced by one of these. This is a \ncream whipper, a close technical cousin to the soda siphon, which you\'ve \nprobably seen making cocktails in "The Thin Man" movies and making messes in \n"Three Stooges" movies. Anyway, the science is very simple. We are going to \ninfuse our mixture with a gas that will both froth and propel our darkness.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Now you\'re going to need a funnel in order to fill the \ncanister, and you want to be very, very careful to never fill it beyond the \nmaximum fill line, because there has to be some room for the gas to compress. \nPlease make certain that the sealing gasket is properly seated in the dispenser \nhead, and... [Itchy and Twitchy enter] Oh yeah, my attorneys, Itchy and Twitchy \nwant me to remind you to read the manufacturer\'s instructions that came with \nyour creamer so you don\'t, I don\'t know, put an eye out? Whatever, all right. \n[they leave]<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; So, screw the dispensing head very firmly into place, and now \nit is time to charge the device. We are using a nitrous oxide canister. It goes \ninto this screw-in housing, and in this particular model, you have to remove the \nnozzle. It\'s different for different types of devices. Screw on until a small \nneedle punctures the canister, and then you\'ll hear the gas rush into the \ncreamer.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Nitrous oxide has become a popular food propellant for the \nsimple reason that it is fat soluble. Unlike, say, carbon dioxide, which is used \nin soda siphons. ["Thing", appears, brandishing a siphon]</p>\n<p><b>AB:</b> Go ahead, Thing. Go ahead. Skin that smoke wagon \nand see what happens. ["Thing" withdraws the siphon, and disappears]</p>\n<p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; That\'s what I thought. Anyway, that\'s why \nnitrous oxide is used in things like canisters of whipped cream. You may have \nalso encountered it in your local dentist\'s office, of course, in the form of \nlaughing gas. [drill noises, and we can hear a man screaming] Is it safe? \nPerfectly, when used properly.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; So we reapply the nozzle, and now the important part, \nvertical shaking. At least 20 shakes. Just pretend it\'s a martini, and then let \nthe canister sit for 60 seconds, so that that nitrous oxide can really soak into \nthe mixture.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; And now the fun part. Grab yourself a glass, turn the creamer \nupside down and push the button. Look at all that dark, foamy goodness. Oh my. \nOf course, you can garnish, if you like, with maybe some mint, and some fresh \nberries - completely optional.</p>\n<h3><b><big>SCENE 1</big><br>\n</b>The Kitchen</h3>\n\n<p>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Well I certainly hope we\'ve inspired you \nto get in touch with the dark side of the food force called chocolate. Too long \nhave we dallied about at the light end of the spectrum. The real art of darkness \nlies in chocolates in the 54 up to 90 plus percentile range. Just remember that \nto properly perform, these chocolates have got to be of high quality, they must \nbe purchased from purveyors who handle them correctly, and they have got to be \nstored in a cool, dry place, lest they bloom, or worse, lose their temper.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; When working with such thoroughbreds, temperature control is \nkey. Use one of these if you can [an infrared thermometer]. And if not, at least \na digital instant-read thermometer.<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; And remember, best of all, dark chocolate is actually good \nfor you - in moderation, of course, as is typically the case of all things Good \nEats. Stay dark, America. [snaps his fingers, and the lights go out]</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n</div>'
